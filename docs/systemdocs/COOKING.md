# Cooking

The Fine and Lavish Meals, the ingredients that go in them, and what eating
one does. Read this before touching `Tag.cooked`, `Tag.cookedFrom`,
`requirement.ingredientSlots`, `web/lib/cooking.js`,
`db/lib/mood.js#dishMoodTerms`, or `IngredientSlots.js`.

Crafting in general is [`CRAFTING.md`](CRAFTING.md); this is the one recipe
family that does something crafting alone cannot.

## 1. What changed, and why

Cooking used to make two flat items. A Fine Meal was always +15 mood and a
Lavish always +30, the Lavish took exactly one delicacy out of a hardcoded
list of four (`items: [anyOf: [tea, sweets, honey, fish-roe]]`), and putting
your own name on a dish cost +1 ⬢. Nothing a cook chose changed what the food
**was** — the ingredient was a gate on the recipe, not a part of the meal.

Now the ingredient is the point:

- The meal's own mood is small (`mealMood`, **5** and **8**) and the
  ingredient carries the rest, from **+45** (saffron) down to **−55** (feces).
- Fine takes 0–1 ingredients, Lavish takes 1–2.
- An ingredient brings its side effects with it. A dish made from a person
  makes the eater nauseous or worse; one made with Squeeze is a seizure.
- Every dish has a **taste**, and eating one says so.
- Naming your work is free.

### 1a. A meal is now the only way to be fed

Eating grants `ate-meal`, and since 9/2026 that tag **is** the whole of being
fed. The Hunger pass asks one question at the close of every turn — is
`ate-meal` on the sheet? — and consumes it if it is (`TURN-ENGINE.md` §5). A
character with none goes Hungry.

That is a bigger job than the tag used to have. Until then the pass **billed**
everyone 1 ⬢ a turn for food and you went hungry only if you could not cover
it, so `ate-meal` was a *shield*: it saved you the 1 ⬢ and dropped a tick of
the streak. Cooking was therefore a losing move on the arithmetic alone — a
Fine Meal costs 2 ⬢ to make and a Lavish 3 ⬢, to spare you a charge of 1 ⬢
— and anybody who never cooked was quietly taxed for existing anyway. The
charge is gone. Nobody pays to eat, and the only way to not be Hungry is for
somebody to have cooked.

So this file matters more than it did, not less. It does **not** mean every
dish must come from this recipe family: anything whose `consumesInto` reaches
`ate-meal` feeds a character, which today includes raw Human Flesh (§4).
Foodstuff items that grant it more ordinarily are the work coming next, and
`ate-meal` is the seam they plug into — nothing about the pass needs to change
to accept them.

## 2. A dish is a minted row

Every meal with words or ingredients on it is a **minted `Tag`** — the fifth
runtime authoring door, the one `CRAFTING.md` §4a already described, now
carrying more than a name. `mintCustomCraft` clones the recipe row
(`custom: true`, `ephemeral: true`, `craftable: false`) and writes two things
on the clone:

| Column | What |
|---|---|
| `cookedFrom` | the ingredient slugs, **sorted** |
| `mealMood` | copied off the recipe |

A meal with **no words and no ingredients** does not mint. It has nothing to
carry, and an ephemeral clone of the base row would only make it
un-Depot-listable and Restart-Game-deletable for no gain. In practice a
Lavish Meal always mints, because it always has an ingredient.

**The ingredients are part of the mint's identity.** Reuse keys on name +
description + `cookedFrom`, so two cooks who both type "Steak Dinner" — one
over saffron, one over feces — get two rows. Nothing on any surface tells them
apart, which is the point. Miss this and one of them is serving the other's
dinner.

**A dish nobody named is named after its taste** — "Lavish Meal (rich
spices)". That rule is for the cook's own pantry rather than for anyone else's
secrecy: every Lavish Meal mints, so without it a cook who named neither of
their two dinners would have two identical rows and no way to tell the saffron
from the feces before biting. A taste is coarser than an ingredient ("meat"
covers a boar loin and a human foot), and the two undetectable poisons have no
taste at all, so it gives away less than it looks. A cook who wants to hide
something types a name.

Sorted rather than kept in slot order because Postgres array equality is
order-sensitive; the cost is that the taste sentence reads alphabetically.

Dishes are swept like disguises — `db/index.js`'s expiry pass deletes
`ephemeral` `custom-craft-` rows nobody holds, that no room holds, and that
no Offer or CraftProject pins.

## 3. `cooked:` — what a tag contributes as an ingredient

```yaml
  fish-roe:
    cooked:
      taste: "little crunchies"
      mood: 28
      into: [nauseous]        # OPTIONAL — read §4

  tomato:
    cooked:
      taste: acidic
      tasteForm: adjective    # OPTIONAL — see below
      mood: 3
      hunger: 12              # OPTIONAL — see below
```

**The presence of this block is the only thing that makes a tag cookable.**
There is no `ingredient: true`, and no recipe names a legal ingredient
anywhere. **58 tags carry one** — the thirteen new ones plus every brew, drug,
body part and relic worth putting in a pot — and adding the fifty-ninth is one
YAML entry and a `db:sync-tags`.

- **`taste`** is a *fragment*, dropped into the middle of one sentence, so it
  is lowercase and under 40 characters. `taste: ""` is legal and means
  **undetectable** — Phrygian Tears and Adder's Bite, the two things a cook
  can hide in a meal with no tell at all. The key is still required, so an
  empty taste is a claim somebody made rather than a field somebody forgot.
- **`mood`** is signed, on the `MOOD.md` scale.
- **`into`** is what it grants the eater, in the same shapes `consumesInto`
  takes (`oneOf` included).
- **`hunger`** is optional — a whole number from 0 to 100, how much this
  ingredient restores on the 0-100 hunger meter (`foodHungerFor`,
  `db/lib/hunger.js`). Absent means "not really food" — eating it still grants
  `ate-meal` if it's tagged for that, but restores nothing.
- **`tasteForm`** is optional and only ever `"adjective"`. By default
  `web/lib/cooking.js` renders `taste` as a noun ("It tastes like onions.");
  `tasteForm: "adjective"` renders it bare instead ("It tastes acidic.").
  Existing tags leave this unset and are unaffected — nobody rewrote the 58
  noun-style tastes to add it.

Both fields were added for the new Soilery crop and foodstuff tags (wheat,
potato, meat, cheese, and the rest) — see [`SOILERY.md`](SOILERY.md) §6 for
the full list and where each one lives.

## 4. Raw is not cooked

**An ingredient with no `into` contributes its own `consumesInto`.** That is
not a fallback, it is the mechanism, and it makes the tag's two halves say two
different things:

| | Raw (`consumesInto`) | Cooked (`cooked.into`) |
|---|---|---|
| Onion | `[]` — nothing | absent → nothing |
| Deep Morel | `[nauseous]` | `[]` — cooking takes the nausea off |
| Moonshine | tipsy, blind-drunk, damaged-vision | absent → all three, still |
| Human Flesh | `[ate-meal]` | `[{oneOf: [nauseous, vomiting]}]` |
| Squeeze | `[seizure]` | absent → a seizure, still |

`into: []` and an absent `into` are **different claims**. The first says
"contributes nothing"; the second says "whatever I do raw". Nine of the
thirteen new ingredients do nothing raw and say so with `consumable: true`
and an empty `consumesInto` — you can put a raw onion in your mouth, and then
nothing happens, which is a real answer rather than a missing one.

**Cookable and edible are different claims.** The six body parts are not
consumable at all and carry `cooked` blocks: nobody gnaws a raw hand, and a
hand in a stew is very much a thing that can happen.

## 5. Medicine in a stew

Half of this needed no hook and half of it did. The half that did is the more
interesting one, so it goes first.

### `cooked.cures` — the opt-in

The medical pass put cures on their own `Tag.cures` column rather than on
`consumesInto`, and a separate column travels nowhere by itself. So an
ingredient's cures ride through the pot only when the ingredient says so:

```yaml
white-honey:
  cooked:
    taste: "medicine"
    mood: 15
    cures: true
```

Default is **off**, because not every cure is swallowed. A tonic somebody
drinks works in a stew; something injected, applied or strapped on does not,
and cooking one into dinner ruins the dinner and cures nothing.

| Rides through the pot | Does not |
|---|---|
| White Honey, Antidote, Fever Draught, Purifier, Antibiotics | Burn Dressing, Leeches, Cleaning Powder, the two autoinjectors, all six prosthetics |

`db/lib/tagShapes.js#validateCooked` refuses the two shapes that are always
authoring slips: `cures: true` on a tag carrying `administerSkill` (that whole
column is cures a doctor *fits*), and `cures: true` on a tag that cures
nothing. `mergeDishCures` in `web/lib/cooking.js` does the union, and
`curesInto` — the aftermath a cure leaves — merges beside it, last ingredient
winning a collision.

A **dish never carries cures of its own.** A Fine Meal is a minted custom
craft off a recipe with no cure on it; the ingredients are the only place one
can come from.

### `into` — the half that was free

White Honey, the Cat and the rest carry a `taste` and a `mood`
and **no `into`**, deliberately. They therefore contribute their own live
`consumesInto`, read at the moment somebody eats the dish rather than frozen
in when it was cooked. Whatever the medical pass makes a medicine *grant*, it
grants in a stew too — for every dish already sitting in every pocket, on the
next bite, with no re-mint, no backfill and no code here.

That is the whole reason effects are derived late (§6). A *new* medical
consumable wants a `cooked:` block with a taste and a mood, `into` left alone,
and `cures: true` only if it is a thing you drink.

## 5a. Poison in a dish

Poison reaches a meal by two routes and they behave differently, which is
worth holding in your head before changing either.

**Laced.** Somebody ran `poisonItemRequest` over the finished dish, or over an
ingredient the cook then used. Either way the taint rides the real stack as
`poisonedCount` / `poisonPayload`, drawn hypergeometrically when units leave,
and the medical pass's existing marker catches it.

**Cooked in.** The cook simply used something poisonous — phrygian tears,
say. This is *not* lacing: the poison rides through
`mergeDishGrants` as the ingredient's own `consumesInto`, and there is no
`poisonedCount` anywhere to notice. This route used to be invisible to Poison
Sense, so a palate that caught a laced bowl missed a bowl that came out of the
pot poisonous.

`dishCarriesPoison` closes that: a dish also reads as tainted when any slug in
its `cookedFrom` is flagged `poison: true`. Derived off `cookedFrom` at read
time like everything else here, so re-flagging an ingredient fixes every dish
already in every pocket.

**Phrygian Tears becomes visible in a dish**, which its authored-empty taste
deliberately hides. That is the intended trade: the tell costs a 5-point trait
or a held gadget (`db/lib/poison.js`), so a Phrygian dish still reads as an
ordinary meal to everyone at the table who has not paid for a palate.

**Iron Constitution shrugs off `nauseous`** alongside the `vomiting` it
already resisted. The seven flesh ingredients roll `oneOf: [nauseous,
vomiting]`, so before this the trait worked on exactly half of a mouthful of
hand, at random — and a raw Deep Morel or Blind Fish got through it entirely.
It stops there on purpose: `phrygian-toxin`, `seizure`, `hallucinating` and
`damaged-vision` are what their items are *for*, not upset stomachs.

## 6. Eating one

`consumeTagRequestImpl`, when the row has a `cookedFrom`:

1. Load the ingredient rows, put back in `cookedFrom` order. A slug that no
   longer resolves is dropped rather than throwing — the dish is already in
   somebody's hands.
2. `mergeDishGrants` (`web/lib/cooking.js`) concatenates the meal's own
   `consumesInto` with each ingredient's cooked contribution, and
   `resolveConsumeGrants` runs **once** over the merged list. One call is
   load-bearing: it tracks what the eater *will* hold across the list, which
   is how the drinking ladder resolves against a rung the same swallow just
   granted. Two calls would each resolve against a stale sheet and
   double-grant.
3. `mergeDishCures` unions the `cures` of every ingredient that opted in with
   `cooked.cures: true` (§5), and the medical pass's cure loop reads that
   merged list rather than the dish row's own.
4. `applyHiddenCures` for the meal **and each ingredient**, so a pie made with
   leeches still takes the bruise off. (Hidden cures are a separate, older
   mechanism from `Tag.cures` — `db/lib/hiddenCures.js` — and they need no
   opt-in.)
5. Mood (§7).
6. Return `{ line }` — the taste sentence.

## 7. Mood

**[`MOOD.md` §6a](MOOD.md) is canonical** — it sits with the rest of the mood
tables, which is where somebody asking "what moves the dial" will look. In
short: `dishMoodTerms` sums the meal's own small figure and its ingredients'
(rather than taking a max, the way every other consume does), returns harm and
relief as two terms so only the harm half is scaled, and flags the harm
`noMultiplier` so nothing in the fright table makes disgust free.

The recipe's own figure is deliberately tiny beside its ingredients' — **5**
for a Fine Meal and **8** for a Lavish, against +45 (saffron) to −55 (feces).

## 8. The taste line

One sentence, in the bottom-right notice (`NoticeProvider`). Composed by
`tasteLine` in `web/lib/cooking.js`; empty tastes are dropped rather than
printed as a gap.

A taste is a **fragment**, not a sentence — it is dropped into the middle of
the composed line, so it carries no punctuation and no closing anything of its
own. `tasteLine` owns the sentence around it.

**Both eating paths raise it.** The one-click Consume on the tag rail is how
people actually eat; it used to throw the server's result away, which would
have meant the taste line only ever reaching the handful who go through the
Actions grid.

## 9. `ingredientSlots`

```yaml
    requirement:
      ingredientSlots: { min: 1, max: 2 }
```

A **sibling** of `requirement.items`, not a second `anyOf`. The legal set is
"any tag carrying a `cooked` block", which no authored list could keep up
with — so `validateRequirementItems`' one-picker cap stays exactly where it
is, still guarding the Death Mask.

Refused on anything not craftable, on a `placement`, and on a **multi-turn
project**: the mint happens on the finishing turn, days after the cook picked,
and nothing carries the slugs that far. Put slots on a 2-turn recipe and they
would have to ride on `CraftProject.custom`.

The server re-checks membership, possession and the count in
`resolveIngredientSlots`. **The same slug twice is refused** — it keeps "it
tastes like onion and onion" off the notice, and it keeps the spend honest.

### The Honey discovery moved, and got better

**`isNonPublicRecipe` must ignore `requirementIngredientSlots`**
(`character/page.js`, which says why at the function). A slots recipe names no
ingredient, so reading its slots the way `items` is read would mark both meals
non-public and hide dinner from the whole game. The secret lives in the chip
list now: Honey appears as something you can slot only if you hold a jar.

## 10. The dialog

Cooking is a **branch inside the Craft dialog**, not a screen of its own: a
cook spends the same Move, pays the same way and stacks the same batch, and
forking `CraftDialog.js` to change one control would double the maintenance.

`IngredientSlots.js` draws a `.slot-row` of `max` slots over `ChipPicker`'s
own row — boxed in a bounded `.pantry` that scrolls, since 58 cookable tags is
well past the "short, local list" ChipPicker's header asks for — borrowed
rather than re-typed — the one thing it needed that
ChipPicker lacked (more than one live answer at a time) is now a per-option
`active`. Click a chip, it fills the first empty slot; click a slot's ✕, it
comes back out.

**The cook is told the taste and nothing else.** No mood figure, no effect
list, no hint that the thing they are about to serve will make somebody vomit
(Bascinet, 2026-09-09). You learn an ingredient by using it, and poisoning
somebody is meant to be a gamble the poisoner takes too.

That is enforced a layer down, not just left to the component:
`web/lib/referenceData.js#cookedTasteOnly` cuts the `cooked` block to its
taste on the server before it crosses, so there is nothing in the browser to
leak. **`cookedFrom` is not in `TAG_CHIP_FIELDS` at all** — a dish says what
it tastes of and never what it was made with. Do not add it.

`/gm/turns` keeps the full block (`moveRows.js`), which is right: a GM
adjudicating should see everything.

## 11. Where the ingredients come from

| Source | What |
|---|---|
| Hunting | Boar Loin, Deer Liver, Goose Fat |
| Fishing | Crayfish everywhere; River Eel in the Forest, Lamprey in the Marshes, Blind Fish in the Caves |
| Farming | Onion (the commonest and cheapest of the thirteen, on purpose) |
| Caving | Rock Salt, `ultracommon` in `db/lib/cavingLoot.js` |
| Room stashes | 3 Deep Morels scattered across the Caves and Depths, 4 more in the Godshroom; 5 Hard Cheeses across the cellars |
| The Depot | Saffron (15 ⬢, three cigarettes), Tinned Butter (10 ⬢) |

Room stashes are a **seed, never a top-up** — the "Seed these items now"
action at `/gm/dev/zones` (`seedRoomStash`, `web/app/(app)/gm/dev/zones/actions.js`):
once the five cheeses are eaten there are no more.

**The fragmentation grenade lands at 0.067% — about 1 in 1,500 draws.**
Getting there is what made the old mining drop die adopt caving's rarity
tiers: under the old uniform draw the floor was 1/poolsize and it would have
shipped eight times too common. (That die is gone now — `MINING.md` §3b — but
the tier vocabulary it borrowed is still `CAVING.md` §3's.)

## 12. Two catalog bugs fixed here

Both were found wiring this up, and both were load-bearing for it — a poison
ingredient has to actually poison somebody.

- **Phrygian Tears** promised `{tag:phrygian-toxin}` and had the same gap, so
  the most expensive poison a Brewer can make did nothing when drunk. Only
  Adder's Bite and the installed poison tooth ever granted the toxin.

The Cat also moved to `catalog: gm`, on Bascinet's call — a hidden recipe the
way Honey and White Honey are.
