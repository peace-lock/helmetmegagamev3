# Crafting, Destroy, and the capability flags

The Craft button on `/character` (it replaced Add Tag), the Destroy button
(it replaced Remove Tag), multi-turn projects, and the four flags on `Tag`
that decide which menu a tag sits in.

## 1. The four flags

Every player tag menu is one boolean on `Tag`, re-checked server-side by the
matching request. Three are hand-written in `docs/tags.yaml`; `removable` is
derived from the category (§5).

| Flag | Menu | Re-check |
|---|---|---|
| `craftable` | Craft | `craftRequest` (`character/requestActions.js`) |
| `removable` | Destroy | `destroyTagRequest` (derived, §5) |
| `healable` | Heal | `healCharacterRequest` via `web/lib/healRequests.js#isHealable` |
| `teachable` | Learn / Teach | `db/lib/lessons.js#teachableSkills` (LESSONS.md) |
| `cures` / `administerable` | Consume, with a target | `consumeTagRequestImpl` (`MEDICAL.md` §1) |

The last row is not a fifth menu flag the way the first four are — every
item already sits in Consume, whatever its `cures` list says. What `cures`/
`administerable` decide is narrower: whether Consume's target picker may
post to someone OTHER than the actor at all (an item curing nothing the
target holds, and not `administerable`, refuses the targeted branch outright,
same server-side re-check posture as the four flags above).

The 9/2026 sweep set `healable: true` on every health tag with a cure and
`teachable: true` on every skill. Health is not `removable` — a wound is
healed, not thrown away, and a condition nobody can cure runs its course or
waits for a medic — which the category rule now gives for free. `docs/tags.yaml`'s header documents each
key. Harm's menu is the one that still reads the category
(`INFLICTABLE_GROUPS` / `INFLICTABLE_SLUGS`, a curated list).

## 2. A recipe

A craftable tag's `requirement:` block is the recipe, and Craft enforces all
of it:

- `skills` — every listed skill, or a higher tier of it, must be held
  (`db/lib/medicalVision.js#satisfiedSkillIds`, the same walk Heal uses).
  The page decides this per recipe (`knownRecipeIds`) and the menu shows only
  those; the server re-checks.
- `resourceCost` — ⬢ per unit, **charged when the work starts**, never
  refunded on cancel or on undo-by-GM of a mid-project turn. Paid by
  **yourself, a Room stash here, or a person standing here** (payer select;
  a person is DM'd "*X paid N ⬢ from your purse toward Y*").
- `turnsCost` — the WORK one unit takes, in Moves, as a **decimal on a
  quarter**. **0** is free of the Move entirely, rationed only by a recipe's
  own `perTurn` if it has one (bliss at 2, bone-mask at 1) — Dead Simple used
  to live here too, off a shared 4-a-turn pool, but that rung costs `0.25`
  now (`SMITHING.md` §2, `DEPOT.md` §4), so `0` is rarer than it was.
  **0.25**, **0.5** and **0.75** are shares of the Routine — four of the
  first fill it, two of the second, one of the third with a quarter left
  over for more work of the same family. An Alcohol is `0.25`, so four fill
  a Routine. **1** is this turn's whole Routine — one per turn, by
  arithmetic. **2+** is a project (§3), one unit per project, whole turns
  only. Quantity is limited by this arithmetic alone (Chris 2026-09-06).
  Anything off a quarter is refused by the sync, because the Move budget is
  exact rational arithmetic and a cost it cannot hold exactly would let a
  character do work they never paid for. It was a `1/N` fraction until
  9/2026, stored as `requirementTurns: 1` + `requirementPerTurn: N`; the
  decimal sits in `requirementTurns` itself now, and the thirds went with
  the old encoding (§2a).
- `perTurn` — a RATION, and **only legal at `turnsCost: 0`**: a hard daily
  cap, and now the only free allowance a 0-turn recipe gets — there is no
  shared pool behind it any more (bliss at 2, bone-mask at 1). It is never a
  work cost — the sync refuses it on anything that costs a Move, because
  for a while it did double duty as the denominator of a `1/N` cost and the
  two meanings drifted (one Routine held 99 Broadswords). Work is
  `turnsCost`, and `0.25` is how you say "four a Routine"; the cap is
  `perTurn`.
- `items` — the ingredients (`CORPSES.md` §8). **Spent by default**,
  `quantity` units per craft, taken off the crafter's own sheet **when the
  work starts** — so a multi-turn project pays up front and `continueCraft`
  does not re-check them. A `group:` entry is *kept* instead: any corpse to
  hand satisfies the Bone Mask, and none is used up. An `anyOf:` entry is a spend the
  player chooses, posted from the dialog as `ingredientChoice` and re-checked
  server-side for membership and possession. A `placement:` recipe may not
  carry `items` at all; the sync refuses the pair.
- `count:` on a spent `items` entry — how many units of THAT ingredient one
  craft takes, on top of the craft quantity. A blank book is `paper` with
  `count: 10`, and three of them take thirty sheets. Defaults to 1, which is
  every recipe written before it existed. Refused on a `group:` and alongside
  `keep: true`, for the same reason `keep: false` is refused on a group: both
  are hold-checks with no single stack to draw from, so the number would mean
  nothing. It rides the chip as `uses Paper ×10`.
- `gambit` is ignored: crafting is always a Routine. The sweep cleared it on
  the two brews that carried one (BREWING.md). **Trinket is the one
  deliberate exception** — but it does not work by this flag actually doing
  anything: `{tag:trinket}` carries no `requirement:` block at all and never
  goes near `craftRequestImpl`. It has its own bespoke request action
  instead, because a self-spoiling recipe (the Craft dialog shows you the
  result before you commit) is a contradiction the dialog can't express. See
  [`TRINKETS.md`](TRINKETS.md) §2.

**Smith's work also needs a forge.** A recipe naming a `smithing-*` or
`builder-*` skill requires Workshop Equipment in reach — held, or set up in a
room you can get into where you stand (`db/lib/equipmentReach.js`). See
[`SMITHING.md`](SMITHING.md) §2a; `needsWorkshop()` in
`web/lib/tagRequests.js` is the shared predicate, so the dialog and the server
cannot disagree.

The purchase-side checks still apply — prerequisite chain, exclusivity,
`conflictsWith`, "already hold a higher tier", non-stackable duplicates
(`craftGrantChecks`). A finished tag lands with `TagSource.CRAFT`, its clock
stamped by `expiryForGrant`, the tiers below it replaced.

## 2a. The Move budget

A Routine is one Move, and crafting can now spend it a **part at a time**. The
rule is one Move's worth of work per turn — and, as of 2026-09-15, that Move
can be split across any mix of families in the same turn, not just one.

**What a craft costs.**

| Recipe | Cost of the Move |
|---|---|
| `turnsCost: 0`, inside its own `perTurn` allowance | nothing — a free action, as before |
| `turnsCost: 0`, past that allowance | `1/perTurn` per extra unit (a fourth bone-mask is a third of a Move) |
| `turnsCost: 0.25`, `0.5` or `0.75` | `quantity × turnsCost` — each unit is that much of a turn's work |
| `turnsCost: 1` | one is a turn's work |
| `turnsCost: 2+` — a project start or continue | the whole Move, every turn it runs — and ONE unit per project, its turns being per piece |

The allowance is the recipe's own `perTurn`, and only that — there is no
shared pool behind it any more (`SMITHING.md` §2, `web/lib/requests.js`).
Going past it used to be refused outright; the ruling (2026-09-05) is that
the allowance stays free and the units after it come out of the Move. So a
recipe with its own `perTurn: 1` still crafts one free, and the second costs
the whole Move. Dead Simple no longer has an allowance to overflow past at
all — it prices at `turnsCost: 0.25` from the first unit, so four of them
fill the Routine outright and a fifth simply has no Move left to spend.

**Decimals on the page, exact rationals underneath.** A cost is authored as a
decimal on a quarter (§2) and a player reads it as one — "0.25 turns", "0.5
of your Move". The budget does not hold it that way: `craftMoveCost`
(`web/lib/craftBudget.js`) turns the decimal into a num/den pair once and
exactly, and everything past that is integer arithmetic — added by
`addFractions`, compared by cross-multiplication in `fitsInRemaining`, never by
a float. That is the reason the quarter rule exists at all: a turn's Move has
to close exactly, and a cost the ledger could only approximate would leave a
sliver behind or come up short, which is a character doing work they never paid
for. Costs were authored as `1/N` fractions until 9/2026, thirds among them;
the thirds are what this argument finally cost.

**A spill denominator is still whatever the ration is.** The quarter rule
binds what a recipe may be *authored* as; it does not bind what the ledger can
hold. A `turnsCost: 0` recipe past its own `perTurn` bills `1/perTurn` per
extra unit, and an allowance is any whole number — so Flesh of Tzchernobog,
rationed 3 a turn, bills a third of a Move for the fourth. The arithmetic
stays exact, because the ledger is rational either way; only the display
rounds, and that one prints as `0.33`.

That fourth Flesh of Tzchernobog has a second price worth knowing: spilling
files an Action, and the one-Move-a-turn row is the day. Three free ones leave
the day open; the fourth spends it, so there is no Mine, Farm or Refine left
that turn. Dead Simple gets no free half of that trade either: at
`turnsCost: 0.25` from the first unit (`SMITHING.md` §2), even one Work Knife
files the `auto:craft` Action, the same as any other Move-costing craft.

**The family.** `craftFamily()` (`web/lib/tagRequests.js`) takes the first of
`brewing`, `cooking`, `smithing`, `builder`, `crafting` that any of the
recipe's `requirementSkills` prefixes match — that fixed precedence, not the
order the skills come back in, since Prisma returns the relation unordered
and a two-trade recipe's family would otherwise depend on row order.
Barbed-net's `fundamentalist` sits beside `crafting` and the recipe is
crafting. A recipe gated outside the
five trades takes its first skill prefix AS its family (bone-mask is
`butcher` work, holy water `blessing` work), and one with no skill at all is
generic `craft` — so EVERY recipe Move-prices by the same arithmetic (Chris
2026-09-06). Bone-mask's ration spilling into a butcher's Move, instead of
walling, is the one behavior this changed.

A turn's Routine can hold any mix of families now. Half a Routine at the
still and half at the anvil is a thing — the only wall is the Move itself:
spill a work knife (`smithing`) into the Move and a sling (`crafting`) still
spends from the same fraction that's left, it just isn't refused for being a
different family. (This changed 2026-09-15; before that, the first family
billed to a turn's Routine locked out every other family for the rest of the
turn.)

**`medical` is a family too, but it is never derived — it is always passed
explicitly.** A routine Heal or an `administerSkill`-gated Consume
(`MEDICAL.md` §2–3) bills through this same arithmetic, but the tag being
priced is an AFFLICTION or a fitted ITEM, not a recipe with
`requirementSkills` for `craftFamily()` to read a trade prefix off — a
skill-less cure like Choking would otherwise fall through to the generic
`craft` family and get labelled as ordinary crafting on the desk. Every
medical caller says `family: "medical"` up front instead of asking
`craftFamily` to guess. `family` is still tagged onto every ledger entry —
it just no longer gates which entries a Routine may hold.

**The eight medicines (`antidote`, `fever-draught`, `burn-dressing`,
`autoinjector`, `portable-surgical-pack`, `last-breath`, `cybernetic-arm`,
`cybernetic-leg`) are ordinary recipes now, not afflictions or fitted
items** — they carry `requirementSkills: [brewing-skilled]` or
`[brewing-expert]`, so `craftFamily()` derives them as `brewing` by the
ordinary rule above, the same as any other brew. `medical` still bills only
healing and `administerSkill` fittings — brewing a batch of Antidote is a
`brewing`-family craft — but a Routine spent Healing someone can now go on
to brew Antidote too, the same turn, as long as the Move has room left. One
Action per character per turn still holds only one Move, so a medic can heal
a patient **and** brew their own medicine in the same turn now, as long as
the two fractions together still fit in it.

**The ledger.** `Action.craftBudget` on the `auto:craft` Action:

```json
{ "usedNum": 3, "usedDen": 4,
  "entries": [{ "tagId": "…", "name": "Choking", "family": "medical",
                "qty": 1, "num": 1, "den": 4 },
              { "tagId": "…", "name": "Alcohol", "family": "brewing",
                "qty": 2, "num": 1, "den": 2 }] }
```

`usedNum/usedDen` is the running total in lowest terms; each entry carries its
own family and fraction, in lowest terms (a straddling order's free half is
`qty` minus the billed `num`). All of it is integer arithmetic
(`web/lib/craftBudget.js`) — four quarters have to be exactly one Move.

Nothing is derived and nothing is cached: **the row is the record.** Every
budget-consuming craft takes the Character `FOR UPDATE` row lock, re-reads the
Action inside the transaction, re-runs the remainder check there, and
`fileAutoRoutine`'s `P2002` catch stays the backstop under even that. The
Action's `description` is rebuilt from the entries each time one lands,
grouped by family so each verb stays in its own voice — "Treating this turn:
Choking. Crafting this turn: 2× Alcohol." — so the desk reads the whole
turn's work in one line. A project turn keeps its own "(2/3)" line, because a
project never shares a turn.

**GM semantics.** **Reject** deletes the Action and the ledger with it
(`deleteActionRestoringTurn`, which needs to know none of this), and the
player may craft again that turn from scratch. There is no Undo of a
finished craft — a GM reversing one works by hand from the audit row (§4).
Nothing in the turn-end push reads `craftBudget`.

**The dialog** quotes all of this before the player commits: the fraction
left as a header line, unaffordable recipes greyed with the reason on the
row, a quantity field clamped to whichever runs out first (ingredients,
budget, the server's 99), and a confirm that says which units are free and
what the rest spend. Every number of it is computed server-side in
`character/page.js` and re-checked by `craftRequest` under the lock — the
dialog is a hint, never the gate.

## 2b. Recipe visibility: known vs secret

`requirement.skills` decides who is *allowed* to make a recipe (§2); a
recipe's own ingredients decide who is even shown it exists.
`knownRecipeIds` (`web/app/(app)/character/page.js`) is the second filter on
top of the skill check: a recipe naming an ingredient whose own
`catalogVisibility` isn't `all` (or, for a `group:` entry, whose group has
any non-`all` member) stays off the Craft menu and the Recipes tab —
`isNonPublicRecipe` — until the character actually holds one of those
ingredients (`satisfiesIngredientsAtQuantityOne`, checked at quantity one: a
hidden recipe only has to prove itself known, not affordable). Holding the
ingredient is what proves you know the recipe calls for it, so once you hold
it, showing you the recipe tells you nothing a document search wouldn't have.
A public recipe that merely names a `catalog: gm` ingredient (honey → Lavish
Meal, and eight more like it) works exactly this way: the ingredient hides
it from everyone who doesn't hold one, and reveals it in full — cost,
turns, every other ingredient — to anyone who does.

**A "secret" recipe is a narrower thing than "a recipe with a hidden
ingredient": it is a craftable whose own *product* — the tag it makes — is
`catalog: gm`, never `catalog: secret`.** Holding an ingredient never
reveals one of these on the Craft menu or the Recipes tab; the gate above
only ever hides or shows a recipe by its *ingredients*, and a secret
recipe's product visibility is a separate field nothing here reads. The
Cathedral's Research skill (`TAGS.md`; the pass is `TURN-ENGINE.md` §2) is
the one way a character can ever learn one of these exists, and even then
only as a blurb on a minted paper — a name and a requirement line
(`PAPERWORK.md`), never a standing Craft-menu entry. `catalog: secret`
products sit a level further out again: hidden even from GMs on every
surface but the unfiltered `/gm/dev/tags` view, and Research never turns one
up.

**`recipePublic` (`Tag.recipePublic`, authored as `requirement.recipePublic:
true`) is the escape hatch from the ingredient gate above** —
`isNonPublicRecipe` checks it first, before the ingredient walk, and lists
the recipe regardless of what its ingredient's group currently contains.
`maggot-milk` is what it is for now: any Brewer should know you can squeeze a
maggot, without having had to find one first. Bone Mask and Death Mask name
`group: items-corpse` and do **not** set the flag: for those two, "you have to
have held a corpse" is the intended discovery mechanic, not a side effect worth
working around.

## 3. Projects

```
CraftProject { characterId, tagId, quantity, turnsNeeded, turnsDone, resourcesCost,
               consumed, payerKey, payerName, status ACTIVE|DONE|CANCELLED,
               startedTurnId, lastTurnId }
```

A table, not an "in progress" pseudo-tag: it has a counter, a payer and a
link to the Move that last advanced it, and a tag would show on 🔍 inspect
and count toward carry.

- **Start** (`craftRequest`, `turnsCost ≥ 1`): needs a **clean** Move
  (`moveWindow` open, no Action this turn — and any fraction already spent on
  a batch craft blocks it, §2a); charges the payer **and spends the
  ingredients**, snapshotting them onto `consumed`; creates the project at
  `turnsDone: 1`; files the Action — `ROUTINE`, `CONFIRMED`, `PASSED`,
  `appliedEffects: {}`, `gmNotes: "auto:craft"`, description "Crafting 4×
  Arrow (1/3).". A one-turn recipe finishes on the spot and puts the
  snapshot straight on the request.
- **Continue** (`continueCraft`): the Craft dialog lists active projects;
  pick one, choose *Keep working on it*. Same Move check; one advance per
  turn (`lastTurnId`); a claim on `turnsDone` so two clicks can't double an
  advance. Turns needn't be consecutive. The recipe's skills and the workshop
  are re-checked — losing either stops the work where it stands — and so is
  incapacitation, which this path was quietly missing. The **ingredients are
  not** re-checked, and must not be: they were spent at the start, so the
  check would fail on turn 2 for a project that is doing nothing wrong.
- **Finish**: the last advance grants the tag and writes the
  `request_craft_tag` audit row (`details { tagId, quantity, resourcesSpent,
  payer, projectId, turnsNeeded, actionId, replaced, consumed }`), and the
  Action reads "Crafted …".
- **Cancel** (`cancelCraft`): status CANCELLED, audit `craft_cancelled`, no
  refund — of ⬢ or of ingredients. Death cancels ACTIVE projects
  (`characterDeath.js`), on the same terms.

The only grant row is the completion's. Mid-project turns leave their own
audit rows (`craft_started`, `craft_continued`) and the Actions themselves,
which the desk shows like any Routine.

## 4. Reversing a craft

There is no Undo. The `request_craft_tag` audit row is a finished craft's
whole record — `details` carries the tag and quantity, the ⬢ and who paid
them, any `replaced` tiers, and the spent ingredients (`details.consumed`,
the `replaced` snapshot shape) — so a GM reversing one works by hand from
/gm/dev, reading that row for what to take off and what to hand back.
Reject of the auto-filed Action remains the full reset for the turn's Move
(§2a).

## 4a. Custom items (`customizable`)

A recipe flagged `customizable:` in docs/tags.yaml (the fine and lavish
meals, the painting, the sketch, the badge, the hat, and — since
2026-09-09 — the plain arms and all the armor on the Smithing ladder,
`SMITHING.md` §3-§4) can be crafted as the maker's OWN: for
**+1 ⬢ a unit** (`CUSTOM_SURCHARGE`, web/lib/customCraft.js) the player sets
a name and/or a description, and either falls back to the base recipe's when
left blank.

**What the words cost is the recipe's own business now** —
`surchargeFor(tag)`, reading `Tag.customCost`, is the one verdict both the
dialog and the server price with. The two meals set `custom: { cost: 0 }` and
buy them out entirely: a cook naming their own dish is the point of cooking
(COOKING.md), not an upsell, and charging for it made every meal in the game
anonymous. `custom: { describable: false }` is the other half — the Fine Meal
takes a name and no description, so the dialog hides the textarea and the
server drops a posted one rather than refusing it.

A **cooked dish always mints**, words or not: what went into it is what it
does, so it needs a row of its own even from a cook who named nothing. Its
mint also keys on the INGREDIENTS as well as the words — see COOKING.md §2,
which is the one place this mechanism does something the rest of the
customizable recipes do not. The displayed name always carries the base identity —
`Steak Dinner (Lavish Meal)`, or `Lavish Meal (custom)` for a
description-only custom — so every surface says what the thing IS and a
custom name cannot impersonate another item.

Mechanically it is the **fifth runtime authoring door** onto the tag catalog
(db/lib/paperMint.js lists the other four): `mintCustomCraft` in
requestActions.js clones the base row — `custom: true` (sync never sees it,
prune skips it), `ephemeral: true` (Restart Game sweeps it),
`craftable: false` (an item, never a recipe) — and the craft grants the
clone. Everything else runs against the BASE recipe: skills, workshop,
ingredients, the Move budget, and the per-turn rations (the grant records
`details.baseTagId`, and all three counters in web/lib/requests.js bill by
it). Identical words reuse the existing mint — ANYONE'S mint, deliberately:
two cooks who type the same name and description are making the same dish,
and their batches stack on one shared row rather than minting twins. The
mint happens OUTSIDE the craft transaction because the name-collision retry
cannot run inside one (paperMint.js's 25P02 trap), and is deleted again if
the transaction fails (a row someone else already holds is FK-pinned and
survives the attempt).

### Who may sign a piece

`customizableSkill:` on the recipe names a tag the maker has to be HOLDING,
and every arm and every piece of armor names `smithing-skilled`. Signing
your work is a skilled smith's privilege — not something an apprentice does
to a cudgel — and the piece's own tier has nothing to do with it: a basic
smith still forges a plain dagger, they just cannot put their name on it.
Omit the key and the recipe is open to anyone who can make the thing, which
is the meals, the painting, the sketch, the badge and the hat.

One verdict, `mayCustomize` in web/lib/customCraft.js, read by both faces:
`/character` ships `customizable` already RESOLVED against the viewer's held
tags, so the dialog's predicate stays one field, and `craftRequestImpl`
re-decides it from the session's own character (a server action is a public
endpoint). Fields posted against a recipe somebody may not customize are
IGNORED, not refused — the same posture as a quantity on a non-stackable.

Deliberately authored per recipe rather than derived from the recipe's own
skills, which is the trick `needsWorkshop` gets away with. Nothing derives
correctly here: a Padded Cap is `crafting` work and still wants the smith's
rung, and the Hat is `crafting` work that must stay open to everyone — and
the two sit in the same tag group. No ancestry walk either: the only rung
above `smithing-skilled` is `smithing-gunpowder`, which carries it as a
`requiredTag`.

### What the clone has to carry

The clone carries `fighting` (a weapon's class, and what it is worth in a
fight), `meleeArmor`, `ballisticArmor`, `concealsIdentity`, `forcesConceal`,
`concealSprite`, `miningBonus` and `carryBonus`. Every one of those was
missing at some point and cost something real: a "Custom Breastplate" with
zero armor, a "Custom Knight's Helmet" that concealed nobody, a signed
Broadsword that counted as no weapon at all. **Any new stat column on `Tag`
needs adding here before a recipe carrying it is made `customizable`**, or
the mint quietly loses it — this has gone wrong twice now.

`customOfSlug` is the other half of that rule, for what a stat column cannot
express. A mint's slug is fresh (`custom-craft-*`), so every rule that reads
a HELD tag's slug back stops seeing it: `db/lib/godflesh.js` names the tools
that cut Godflesh and the body armor that survives the Spillway, and a signed
breastplate would have protected nobody. That module resolves through
`customOfSlug` now, and so must the next rule of its shape.
`db/lib/torture.js`'s Trench Knife bonus is the one that does not — the
Trench Knife is not customizable, and stays that way for exactly this reason.
Granting a tag by slug (`cavingLoot.js`, `thanati.js`, `threats.js`) is
unaffected; only matching a held row is.

Armor and headgear needed one more change first: `validateCustomizable`
refuses `customizable` on anything non-stackable, and every armor/headgear
tag was non-stackable — one Breastplate, ever, was the whole enforcement of
"you already have that tag." Bascinet's call (2026-09-09): it's fine for a
character to carry more than one, so every armor and headgear recipe on the
Smithing ladder is now both `stackable: true` and `customizable: true`. The
equip system already handled a stackable, layered, equippable tag correctly
before this — the Hat proved it — so a second Breastplate just fights the
first one for the BODY/3 layer exactly like a second Hat would
(`db/lib/equipSlots.js`).

Player words are cleaned by `cleanCustomText` (web/lib/customCraft.js): no
`{}` (a description must not forge a `{tag:…}` chip), no `@` (item names
travel into Discord), no control characters, hard length caps.
There is no GM pre-approval — same posture as paper and book titles — and
the audit row and the dev panel remain the recourse.

The **wayside shrine** is the structure-side variant: `placement.inscribable`
lets the builder write an optional line, stored on `Structure.inscription`
and printed by Examine IN PLACE of `placement.examine`, `»`-prefixed and
unmarked. Blank keeps the stock text.

Two deliberate exclusions. The Depot's price book filters `ephemeral` rows,
so a custom painting never becomes a public line with a player's words on it
(selling one still works — the sell path reads the held row). And
`customizable` is refused at sync on anything not craftable+stackable or
carrying `placement` (db/lib/tagShapes.js#validateCustomizable) — a
non-stackable custom would dodge the base recipe's one-per-character checks.
The same validator refuses a `customizableSkill` that names no real tag, or
one left behind on a recipe whose flag has come off: a typo there would close
the door to everybody rather than fail loudly.

## 5. Destroy

**Destroy is for things you own.** `Tag.removable` is not authored per tag
any more — `db/lib/syncTags.js` DERIVES it: every tag in the **Items** or
**Assets** category has the Destroy menu and nothing else ever does. The YAML
key survives as an opt-out with `false` as its only legal value, on the seven
rows an item is not allowed to be binned from — the three monster corpses
(Butcher and Bury are the two ways a body leaves, `CORPSES.md`), the Nuclear
Device and its Datacard (`SECRETS.md`), the grafted Quickened Nerve Braid, and
the bolted-down Packaging Equipment (`FACTORY.md`). The sync throws on
`removable: true` anywhere, and on a `false` outside those two categories where
it would do nothing.

This replaced a flag hand-set on 327 entries, which had drifted badly: 113
Items could not be destroyed — every book, every wax seal, every helmet,
`paper` itself — while a Belief could be. **A player holding a letter now has a
way to throw it away**, and Post-Christian no longer offers one.

Runtime-minted rows never pass a sync, so each sets the flag itself:
`paperMint.js` and `photoMint.js` true, `corpseMint.js` false, a packed crate
true, a custom craft inheriting its base recipe's.

**Two knock-ons.** A **Belief can no longer be converted by the player** —
they are `exclusive:` and dropping one was Destroy, so a conversion is a GM's
to make and the store's error just names the pair. And the `/store` loophole
rule (a negative-cost tag must be neither removable nor consumable) is now
half-automatic: a drawback is never an item, so the guard's `removable` arm
only ever fires on a GM-authored custom row.

`destroyTagRequest` itself is unchanged: drops the tag you hold, rolls
`removesInto` aftermath, files `REMOVE_TAG`. No ⬢ field and nothing refunded.
