# Thanati

The death cult as gameplay: who is one, what they carry, the four buttons in
the **THANATI** section of `/character`, and the rite pipeline — which has no
button at all. The two seats a GM hands out are `THREATS.md`; the rationale,
the fate guidance and the round scripts are `SECRETS.md` §5 (gitignored).

## 1. Who is a Thanati

Whoever holds the `thanati` Belief (`docs/tags.yaml`, `catalog: secret`). The
leader holds `thanati-leader` on top. Both arrive by Assign or Spawn
(`db/lib/threats.js`), each kit now also granting `underquarter-basements`
(the way into the cult's usual start, `docs/zones.yaml`) and `literate`.
Points: 4 for a cultist, 7 for the leader.

Nobody outside the faith sees the Belief. `Tag.inspectVisibility` stays
HIDDEN; `db/lib/examine.js#examineReadout` adds one line — "Thanati" or
"Thanati Leader" — only when the **viewer** holds `thanati`
(`viewerIsThanati`, passed by `examineActions.js`). Robes and mask are
ordinary worn equipment and show to anyone.

The cult is a set of tags and nothing else. Cultists keep whatever seat they
hold in the open; the roster is Recall Comrades, and the hideout is a pointer
on `GameState`.

## 2. The tags

| Slug | What |
|---|---|
| `flesh-of-tzchernobog` | Craftable by a Thanati: 1 ⬢, Dead Simple, 3 a turn. Eating it grants `dark-inspiration`. Not a meal — no `ate-meal`. |
| `dark-inspiration` | Status, 2 turns (`durationTurns`). Half of what makes a chant count. |
| `black-robes` | BODY armor, `visible: worn`. Craftable by a Thanati, 1 ⬢, no Move cost (`turnsCost: 0`, uncapped — not Dead Simple, just free). The other half of a counted chant. The combat line in its description is prose for a GM. |
| `thanati-mask` | Pre-existing headgear, conceals identity. |
| `grimoire` | Craftable from one `blank-book`, Dead Simple, 1 a turn. Holding it unlocks the **Grimoire** document. |
| `madness` | The Rite of Madness's yield. Two turns, and description-only: nothing enforces the attacking, a GM does. |
| `poison-tooth` / `installed-poison-tooth` | Bought from the shelf, consumed into the installed half. Biting down is adjudicated, not a button. |
| `adders-bite` | A phial, consumed into `phrygian-toxin`. |
| `dynamite-stick` / `dynamite-bundle` | The bundle is an ordinary Craft recipe with an enforced ingredient: five sticks, no skill. |
| `sacrificial-knife` | A knife. Shelf only. |
| `radio-27065` | Shelf only, at 20. Not a weapon but a channel: holding one opens `#27.065`, and everyone else holding one hears you (`CHANNELS.md` §7). Tradeable, so a radio that leaves the cult takes the frequency with it. |

The Basements stash (`docs/zones.yaml`) starts with one robe, four daggers and
nineteen sheets of paper.

"Thanati equipment", for the robes' combat line, means whatever
`THANATI_WARES` in `db/lib/thanati.js` sells. That list carries ONE price per
ware now, not an obol column and a ⬢ column: an obol is one ⬢ (`DEPOT.md`), the
two were always equal, and Purchase Gear spends both together.

## 3. The buttons (`web/app/(app)/character/thanatiActions.js`)

All four are declared in `actionRegistry.js` under `THANATI` and **hide**
rather than grey on `isThanati` / `isThanatiLeader` (own-sheet facts).
`character/page.js` resolves the flags and the dialog data; every action
re-checks the tag from the session.

- **Recall Comrades** — an instant verb (no dialog; `components/actions/
  index.js#INSTANT`). Returns `listComrades()` to the page, and the notice
  under the button lists every living cultist as `Name · Role`, leader first
  and marked `[LEADER]`. It used to go out as a DM; the page is private
  already. Free, no Move. Audit `request_recall_comrades`.
  `formatComrades` is still in `db/lib/thanati.js` for a Discord caller.
- **Recover Equipment** — an instant verb with a one-line confirm, since it
  spends the Move. The button's label is what it would hand back ("Recover
  Robes & Mask", "Recover Mask"; `actionRegistry.js#labelFor`) and it greys
  with "You have both." once nothing is missing. Grants whichever of
  `black-robes` / `thanati-mask` the cultist lacks and says so in the notice.
  Spends the Move (`web/lib/moveSpend.js`, lifted out of
  `requestActions.js` for this). Cooldown of one turn: refused if an audit
  row `request_recover_equipment` by this player carries this turn's or the
  previous turn's `turnId` — the ration-counts-rows pattern.
- **Set Hideout** (leader only) — picks a room at the leader's current
  Location that `accessibleRooms` says they can enter; writes
  `GameState.thanatiHideoutRoomId` (a snapshot id, no FK). Re-settable.
- **Purchase Gear** — greyed unless standing at the hideout's Location. Pays
  from **four pools**: the hideout room's ⬢ and its `obol` stack, and the
  buyer's own of each. The two controls are PREFERENCES, not restrictions —
  which currency drains first and which purse — and the rest cover whatever is
  left, so a cult with the money spread across four piles can still buy. All
  four are decrement-as-check inside one transaction. Goods land on the hideout
  floor via `addToRoomStack` whoever paid; the room hears the ordinary stash
  line. Audit `thanati_purchase`, with the split it actually took.

## 4. Rites — no button

A rite happens because the room heard the right word from the right people
while the right things lay on its floor. `docs/systemdocs/THANATI.md` §4 is the
whole mechanism:

1. **Words.** `db/lib/rites.js#RITES` is the catalog (name, minimum chanters,
   ingredients, Bascinet's description, `run`). `rollRiteWords` gives every
   rite one to three words from `THANATI_DICTIONARY`, rerolling any phrase
   that nests in another. `db/lib/riteWords.js#ensureRiteWords` rolls lazily
   into `GameState.riteWords` the first time anything asks (a chant, the
   Grimoire document, the GM panel) with a guarded `updateMany` so two first
   readers cannot both roll. Restart Game recreates GameState, so a new game
   rolls new words. A rite ADDED to the catalog mid-game would otherwise never
   get one, so `ensureRiteWords` also tops up: `rollRiteWords(rng, RITES,
   existing)` keeps every phrase already rolled, counts it among the taken, and
   rolls only the missing keys.
2. **The chant hook.** `db/lib/say.js#recordSpeech` calls
   `db/lib/riteChant.js#noteChant` after every archived line, on both faces,
   fire-and-forget. It counts a chant when the place is a Room thread
   (`room:`) or a Conversation linked to one (`conv:` → `PlayerThread.roomId`),
   the line **contains** a rite's phrase (`normalizeChant`: NFKC, lowercase,
   letters only; whole-word run, rolled order), and the speaker is wearing
   `black-robes` **and** holds `dark-inspiration` (`chanterReady`). It joins
   the live `RiteAttempt` for that rite in that room (OPEN or READY, opened
   inside twelve hours) or opens one, writes a `RiteChant`, and re-judges.
3. **READY.** Distinct chanters ≥ `minChanters` and the floor ingredients
   present (`floorHas`: `RoomTag` stacks, ⬢ among them since they are a stack
   row like anything else now — `db/lib/resourceStack.js`; the
   person/corpse/photograph/weapon kinds are the scripted rite's to judge and
   count as present until then) → `status: READY`, `firesAt = now + 2 min`,
   and the room hears, once, as `-#` subtext: *You feel tense... Anyone else
   who wants to participate should join in now.* (Bascinet's line.)
4. **The sweep.** `db/lib/riteSweep.js#runRiteSweep`, every minute on the bot
   (`ready.js`). OPEN past twelve hours → EXPIRED. READY past `firesAt` →
   re-check the floor (gone → back to OPEN, clock cleared), claim the row
   (`updateMany where status READY`), consume the floor ingredients, run the
   rite's effect (`riteEffects.js#EFFECTS[key]`, §9), stamp participants
   (distinct chanters still ALIVE), write one audit row `rite_fired`. Firing
   is within a minute of the mark, not on the second. An effect that throws
   is recorded on the row (`result.error`) and shown on the GM panel.

Several rites may run in one room at once; the ingredients are the only real
contention. A non-cultist who has robes, Flesh and a Grimoire chants like
anyone else — nothing here reads the Belief.

## 5. The Grimoire document

`docs/documents.yaml` `grimoire`, gated on the **Grimoire** tag name, body
`{grimoire}`. `web/app/(app)/documents/page.js` swaps the marker for
`web/lib/grimoire.js#grimoireBody(words)`: one block per rite —
`**Name** | Minimum cultists: N | Ingredients: …`, the description, and
`_Word of the Circle:_ {word:phrase}`. `{word:…}` is a token whose payload is
the text; `DocumentMarkdown`, `RichText` and `ChipText` render it as a
`.chip.word-chip`. Documents have no literacy gate, which is why every seat
kit grants Literate.

## 6. GM surface

`/gm/dev?s=antagonists` → **Rites** (`threats/RitesPanel.js`), read-only:
rite → phrase, and attempts (OPEN/READY plus the last fired) with room,
status, chanters, opened, fires-at.

## 7. Tables and what Restart wipes

`RiteAttempt` (rite, room snapshot, status OPEN/READY/FIRED/EXPIRED/CANCELLED,
opened/ready/fires/fired, participants, result) and `RiteChant` (attempt,
character snapshot, archive seq). `wipeGameData` deletes the attempts; chants
cascade. `GameState.riteWords` and `thanatiHideoutRoomId` go with the row.

## 8. Where the code lives

| File | What |
|---|---|
| `db/lib/rites.js` | Catalog, dictionary, roll, matcher (pure) |
| `db/lib/riteWords.js` | `ensureRiteWords` |
| `db/lib/thanati.js` | Slugs, roster, hideout, wares, `chanterReady` |
| `db/lib/riteChant.js` | The chant hook and `evaluateAttempt` |
| `db/lib/riteSweep.js` | Expire / fire / rearm |
| `db/lib/ascensionPass.js` | The end of the world, at a turn close |
| `db/test/rites.test.js` | The pure half |
| `web/lib/moveSpend.js` | `requireFreeMove`, `fileAutoRoutine` |
| `web/lib/grimoire.js` | The Grimoire body |
| `web/app/(app)/character/thanatiActions.js` | The four actions |
| `web/app/components/actions/HideoutDialog.js`, `PurchaseDialog.js` | The two that open a dialog |
| `web/app/(app)/gm/dev/threats/RitesPanel.js` | The GM view |

## 9. The rite scripts

`db/lib/riteEffects.js#EFFECTS`, one handler per rite key, run by the sweep on
the top-level client after the floor is eaten. What each does, in Bascinet's
words where a room or a player hears anything:

| Rite | Needs (resolved by `riteIngredients.js`) | Does |
|---|---|---|
| Initial | 1 chanter | DMs every participant the cult's objectives with Success!/Incomplete |
| Conversion | a Bound character at the Location with access to the room, not Pious, not already Thanati; leaders first | grants `thanati` (Belief conflicts resolved), pins the convert-* objectives naming them, DMs them, room hears "…’s eyes widen…" |
| Sacrifice | a Bound character with access | pins the living sacrifice-* objectives, **gibs** them (`killByRite`, `gib: true`), 2–7 remains + 1–2 Flesh + 2–5 ⬢ on the floor. No corpse is minted at all — see `CORPSES.md` §1a |
| Scrying | 15 ⬢ | a `scrying-eye` on the floor |
| Possession | a weapon stack on the floor, 15 ⬢ | one unit becomes a custom "<Name> (Animated)" copy, indestructible |
| Reanimation | a corpse on the floor, 1 heart, 5 ⬢ | `reviveByRite`: ALIVE in this Location with `ghoul`, `servant-of-tzchernobog`, `hungerless`; role, Cursed and placement restored |
| Stupidity | 1 squeeze, a photograph (floor first, then hands), 5 ⬢ | target gets `stupid`; the print is spent |
| Omniscience | 1 skinless-brain, a photograph | every participant is DMed the target's full tag list; print spent |
| Summoning | 1 saltpeter, 15 ⬢ | every living Thanati not on hallowed ground moves to this Location and is unbound |
| Panic | 1 heart, 20 ⬢ | room hears "Name a zone."; status **AWAITING**; the next participant line naming a Zone (else a Location) sets everyone there to mood −100, Panicking (`answerPanic`) |
| Reflection | 1 black-robes (floor), 15 ⬢ | `shimmering-robes` on the floor (counts as robes for chanting) |
| Rage | 1 ravenheart-red | every participant gets `rage`: every mood harm ×0, Desires locked but cruelty |
| Judgement | 1 heart, 2 eye, a photograph, 40 ⬢; target not Pious, not on hallowed ground | target **gibbed** wherever they stand, their Location hears "… explodes into mist!", remains dropped in a random public Room there — there is no body to drop them beside |
| Madness | 1 phrygian-tears, a photograph, 15 ⬢; same target rule as Judgement | target gets `madness` for two turns; the print is spent |
| Fulfillment | nothing on the floor — but the **leader must be among the chanters**, and it fires once per game | 100 ⬢ per completed cult objective, on the room's floor; room hears "Bounty! What success!" |
| Ascension | 1 barons-scepter, 1 bishops-mitre, 250 ⬢, eight chanters | arms the end of the world for two turns' time and tells every zone where it is being planned |

**Ascension is the second way a game ends** and is built like the bomb, on
purpose. The rite stamps `GameState.ascensionArmedTurn = openTurn + 2` and
snapshots the leader into `ascensionLeaderCharacterId`; `db/lib/ascensionPass.js`
runs each close, beside `nukeExplosionPass` and after the staged push, so a
leader killed this turn beats the clock. If that leader is not ALIVE the
countdown is cleared and nothing more is said. Otherwise `ascensionFiredTurn`
is stamped (never cleared), every `#summary` hears the hellfire line, the game
ends through `endGameInDb`, and `turnBannerPath` pins `hellfire.jpg` on for
good — for **this** game: the stamp is written to `Game.ascensionFiredTurn`,
not to `GameState`, so the next game starts under a clean sky
(`TURN-ENGINE.md` §banner). A GM can also call it off from `/gm/dev?s=reports`, beside Defuse.

**The hellfire kills everyone**, gibbed, with no zone exemption — not even the
caves. That is the whole difference between the two endings: the bomb leaves
survivors underground with a game to keep playing, and this leaves nothing to
play.

**If the bomb and the rite come due on the same close, the cult wins.** The
ascension pass runs before `nukeExplosionPass` for exactly that reason: the
blast would otherwise kill the snapshot leader and cancel the rite. By the time
the bomb runs there is nobody left alive for it to find, and the epilogue is the
cult's, because `endGameInDb` is a no-op once the state is ENDED.

Fulfillment's "leader must be present" and "once a game", and Ascension's
"not while one is already running", are checked in `riteIngredients.js` with
the Pious and hallowed-ground rules — **not** in the handlers. The sweep eats
the floor before it runs an effect, so a refusal from inside one would have
swallowed a sceptre, a mitre and 250 ⬢ for nothing. Upstream it is an ordinary
rearm and costs the circle only its two minutes.

**The consumption line is universal.** A rite whose only thing to say is "the
floor is gone" says `INGREDIENTS_CONSUMED` — *The ingredients evaporate into
dust.* — and nothing else. The flavoured lines (the eyeball, the shimmering
robes, the rising corpse, the exploding sacrifice) are what the rite MADE and
stay as they are.

"Hallowed ground" is `HALLOWED_LOCATION_SLUGS` (the Cathedral) in
`riteIngredients.js`, a code constant rather than a zone attribute so it needs
no sync. A rite whose resolved target is invalid never fires and never eats its
floor: the sweep sends it back to OPEN with `result.rearmed` naming what was
missing.

Photographs: `Tag.photoOfCharacterId` (set by `photoMint.js` from both
cameras) names the subject; older prints fall back to the name on the print.
A Ghoul's speech goes through `babble.js#growl` (say.js `growling`). The
Scrying Eye is `feedAccess.js#hasScryingEye`: equipped, **robes on**
(`ROBE_SLUGS`, so the Rite of Reflection's pair counts) **and** web-only —
then every room and conversation at the Location becomes readable, `canSpeak:
false`. The robes are Bascinet's rule, and they mean a stolen eye is worth
nothing to a thief who is not in the cult's dress.
