# Documents

The in-game reference library: rules, briefs and lore sheets, handed to a
player because of who they are rather than because they went looking.

## 1. The master

`docs/documents.yaml`, matched by `key`, synced by
`db/lib/syncDocuments.js#syncDocumentsFromYaml` (`npm run db:sync-documents`).
It runs **last** of the four YAML syncs, because it validates against tags and
roles — see `SYNC.md`.

The sync is **destructive**: a key dropped from the YAML loses its row. That
puts it in a different category from the zones master now — `docs/zones.yaml`
is an additive, one-shot importer that never deletes (`SYNC.md`) — but a
Document is pure reference content with no player state to preserve, so a
prune here is safe in a way a zone prune no longer is.

## 2. The page

`/documents` (`web/app/(app)/documents/`) is a pinned board of expandable
cards, in five document tabs — with two catalog tabs alongside them (§2a):

- **PUBLIC** — every `public: true` document, readable by any signed-in user,
  character or not. This is deliberate: the site goes up before the game opens
  so players can read the rules, and launch gating covers character *creation*
  only (`CHARACTERS.md`).
- **ASSIGNED** — **not rendered at all** without an `ALIVE` character, rather
  than rendered empty.
- **GAMEMASTER** — `flags: [gamemaster]` papers, and the one source that keys
  off a **Discord role** rather than anything on a Character, since a GM
  usually has no character. The tab only exists when the server actually sent
  GM papers, so its absence is never a hint that something is being withheld.
- **SECRET** — `secret: true` papers (threat briefs), visible **only to the
  host** — a GM who is also a superadmin (`web/lib/superadmin.js`). This used
  to ask "holds no zone seat", which meant the same thing back when only the
  master was unseated; a zone seat is now a zone VIEW that every GM sets for
  themselves and an unset one is the default, so left alone the first GM to
  ignore the control would have been handed every secret in the game. It asks
  the question it always meant. A secret document can
  also be assigned via tags, so a player with the `Demoness` tag still sees the
  Demoness brief in their Assigned tab — the two paths are independent.
- **ALL** — every written document in the game, on the same Discord-role gate
  as GAMEMASTER and likewise absent for a player. A GM's overview rather than
  anyone's folder, so its source line answers a different question from the
  other tabs': not *why is this in your folder* but *how does this paper reach
  a player at all* — `Public`, `Gamemaster`, `Assigned`, or **`Unrouted`** for
  a written paper nothing hands out. Spotting those is the point; answering it
  honestly costs one extra query for `Role.docElements`, run only for a GM.
  Secret papers are the one exception to *every* document: they stay gated to
  master GMs here exactly as in SECRET, so a zone-GM's ALL never leaks a threat
  brief they cannot open.

### 2a. The two catalog tabs

TAGS and RECIPES are not documents. They are `Tag` rows, and they share one
query, one payload and one visibility pass, so nothing sent to the browser can
disagree with itself about who may see what.

- **TAGS** — the player-facing Tag Catalog, the read-only sibling of
  `/gm/dev/tags`. `catalogTags()` (`web/lib/tagCatalog.js`) filters it
  server-side on each tag's own `catalog:` flag: SECRET reaches nobody, GMs
  included; GM reaches a GM, or a player whose character RELATES to the tag
  (holds it, is granted it by their role's kit, holds its group's key tag, or
  holds the Merchant's Licence for a Depot ware); ALL reaches everyone.
- **RECIPES** — the same rows narrowed to `craftable`, each laid out as its
  `requirement:` block (`CRAFTING.md` §2) and filed under the **discipline**
  of the skill that gates it. The discipline is the skill's name with its rung
  dropped, so Brewing I and Brewing II are one section and
  Smithing (Gunpowder) sits with Smithing — derived rather than mapped, so a
  new rung needs no edit. A reference book, not a menu: a recipe is listed
  whether or not the reader holds its skills, its ⬢ or its ingredients, which
  is the whole difference between this and the Craft dialog's list.

**A recipe that NAMES an ingredient the reader may not see is dropped whole**
(`redactWithheldRecipes()` in `web/lib/recipeCatalog.js`), rather than shown
with the name blanked. Moonshine needs Godflesh and White Honey needs Honey,
both `catalog: gm`; those are meant to be found in play, or
worked out by handing something strange to a good crafter, and a redacted line
advertises the secret as loudly as the name would. The pass clears
`requirementItems` on the shared row, so a withheld ingredient cannot resurface
through TagChip on the TAGS tab either.

**A recipe gated on a SKILL the reader may not see loses the whole recipe**, not
one line of it. The wax seals are public objects — a courtier buys
their own mark openly, everyone can read what a Fleur de Lis looks like, and
every office's stamp is a known thing — but the only way to MAKE one is
Forger, a Brigand-only `catalog: gm` skill.
Printing "Forger · 1 turn · 2 ⬢" under a seal tells the whole game that seals
get forged, which is exactly what the forger is paying for. So every
requirement column is cleared for that reader and the tag simply stops looking
craftable: name, description and honest point cost stay. The same rule runs on
three surfaces, because the recipe reaches the browser three ways — the
/documents catalogs and the site-wide hovercard through
`redactWithheldRecipes()`, the buy menus through `recipeFields()` in
`web/lib/pointBuyCatalog.js`, and the sheet's own Add-tag and Craft menus
through `clientTagCatalog` in `web/app/(app)/character/page.js`. Only the buy
menus judge on `catalogVisibility` alone; the other two let holding the skill
count, so a Forger reads their own recipe everywhere.

A `group:` ingredient names no tag and hides nothing. The Bone Mask asks for "a
corpse" (`{ group: items-corpse }`) and every member of that group is
`catalog: secret` — counting groups would erase a public recipe from everyone,
GMs included, over a line that gives away nothing.

An `anyOf:` ingredient is softer still: the recipe is makeable with any one
member, so an unseen member NARROWS the entry — a cook shown tea and honey
reads "Tea or Honey" — and only a reader shown no member at all loses the
row. The same pass, with an explicit public-or-held visibility set, runs
inside `getVisibleTags()` (`web/lib/referenceData.js`), so the site-wide
`{tag:…}` hovercards obey the same rule the two catalog tabs do.

Opening a card is a `Modal` (`DESIGN-SYSTEM.md` §8) over `.doc-sheet` — wider
and more generously set than an ordinary dialog, because it is a page of prose.

**Every open sheet lives at `?doc=<key>`**, and it is derived from that param
on every render rather than seeded once into `useState`. Clicking a card
`router.push`es the param; a `{document:…}` chip is a plain `<Link>` to the
same URL, so clicking one while a different sheet is already open re-derives
`open` from the new param and swaps the sheet in place — no remount needed,
and no dead click where the URL changed but the sheet didn't. Closing
`router.replace`s the param away, so Back from an open sheet lands on the
board rather than stepping back through sheets, and a refresh always lands on
the board. The open sheet also carries a `⧉ Copy link` button, Prev/Next
(and `←`/`→`/`j`/`k`) stepping through whichever tab the open document came
from under the board's current search and sort, and — once a document has
three or more headings — a generated table of contents alongside the prose,
built by `web/lib/documentHeadings.js` off the same heading text
`DocumentMarkdown.js` slugs into `id`s, so the two never disagree about where
`#some-heading` points.

The board above the sheet carries a search box (name, source and body,
case-insensitive) and a Default/A–Z/Source sort — all client-side, since
`DocumentsPage` already sent every document the reader may see.

### Your role, pinned

The first card in ASSIGNED is the reader's own **role charter** — `Role.name`
over `Role.description`, which is a `String[]` of plain sentences in
`docs/roles.yaml`, joined into a Markdown bullet list. It is accent-framed and
marked `⌗ YOUR ROLE` so it reads as being about the reader rather than about
the world.

It is **synthesized in the page, not a `Document` row**, so `{document:…}` can
never resolve to it and the sync never sees it. Skipped entirely for a
character with no role or an empty description.

Worth knowing if you edit `docs/roles.yaml`: that field was written and synced
for all 49 roles and **rendered nowhere** until this existed. The nearest a
player got was the one-line `role.intro` in the creation wizard.

Documents with an empty `description` are filtered out. Several are still
stubs, and a slot awaiting prose shouldn't reach a player as a blank page.

### The Handbook, pinned

The first card in PUBLIC (before any real `public: true` document) is the
**Player Handbook** — `docs/handbook.md`, read at request time by
`web/lib/handbook.js#getHandbookBody` (its leading `# Bascinet Player
Handbook` H1 stripped, since both surfaces that render it already carry the
title in their own chrome) and synthesized into the same pinned-card shape as
the role charter above, key `"handbook"`. Public rather than Assigned: it's
the tab a character-less visitor lands on, and it's exactly what that visitor
wants. Skipped entirely if `docs/handbook.md` can't be read.

Like `"role"`, `"handbook"` is a reserved key in
`db/lib/syncDocuments.js#RESERVED_KEYS` — a real document taking it would
collide with the synthesized card and make `?doc=handbook` ambiguous.

The same file also backs a second, standalone surface: **`/handbook`**
(`web/app/(public)/handbook/`), a public page that needs no sign-in — the
`(public)` route group is the one place in the app that renders for an
anonymous visitor, specifically so `ravenheart.quest/handbook` works as a bare
link handed to someone who hasn't joined the game yet. Its nav rail tab (`?`
icon, next to Documents in both `PLAYER_NAV` and `GM_NAV`) only shows for a
signed-in reader, same as everywhere else in the app.

## 3. Assignment

Resolves server-side, in `web/lib/documentAccess.js`. That module is shared
with `/api/documents` **on purpose**: the API decides whether a
`{document:key}` chip is a working link or an inert one, and two copies of a
visibility rule drift. The failure it prevents is telling a player they can
open a Gamemaster brief.

Each card shows **the reason it's in your folder**, in an alt colour — it's
metadata about the paper, not part of it.

Five things can put a document in front of you:

| Source | Key in the YAML |
|---|---|
| Your role's document list (the primary link) | `doc_elements` in `docs/roles.yaml` → `Role.docElements` |
| A tag you hold | `tags:` |
| Your role slug | `roles:` |
| `gamemaster` — the Discord GM role, resolved at request time | `flags:` |

Those are **denormalized onto `Document` as string arrays**, not join
tables: ~30 rows, rebuilt wholesale each sync, read in one query per page view.

## 4. One deliberate softness

In an otherwise strict sync, `documents.yaml`'s `tags:` lists conflate three
different things: real Tag names, the `gamemaster` flag, and free-text
authoring notes like `"any of the medical tags"`.

Each entry is routed to whichever bucket it belongs in, and **anything matching
nothing is reported, not thrown** — a placeholder is a note to a human, and
failing the sync over one would block every other document.

The explicit `roles:` / `flags:` keys are **strict** and throw on
a typo. Only `tags:` is soft.

## 5. Referring to a document

`{document:key}` anywhere tokens render — a document body, a tag description —
becomes a chip that links to the paper it names. The payload is
`Document.key`, the same identifier `doc_elements` uses; documents have no
separate slug. See `TAGS.md` §7 for the token system as a whole.

The chip is access-aware, which is the only interesting part. `/api/documents`
ships every written document's **name**, but its source and excerpt only to a
reader who may open it:

- **Readable** → a hoverable chip showing name, source and an excerpt, linking
  to `?doc=<key>`.
- **Not readable** → the same chip, muted and inert.

Inert rather than plain text so the reference still reads as a reference — you
can see a paper exists and that it is not yours. The name is not a leak: the
token sits in prose the reader is already looking at, and it is what lets the
chip say *which* paper it is.

Inside a tooltip or a card preview the chip is always the flat, inert form —
those render through `ChipText.js`, where a link would be invalid markup
inside the `<button>` a card is.

## 6. Where the code lives

| Concern | File |
|---|---|
| Master | `docs/documents.yaml` |
| Sync | `db/lib/syncDocuments.js`, `db/scripts/sync/sync-documents.js` |
| Page | `web/app/(app)/documents/` |
| Visibility rule (shared) | `web/lib/documentAccess.js` |
| Chip index | `getDocumentIndex()` in `web/lib/referenceData.js` (the standalone `web/app/api/documents/route.js` this table used to point at no longer exists — the logic moved here) |
| Chip | `web/app/components/DocumentChip.js`, `DocumentsProvider.js` |
| Role document lists | `docs/roles.yaml` (`doc_elements`) |
| Handbook source | `docs/handbook.md`, read by `web/lib/handbook.js` |
| Handbook standalone page | `web/app/(public)/handbook/`, `web/app/(public)/layout.js` |
| Sheet heading slugs / ToC | `web/lib/documentHeadings.js` |
| Tag Catalog tab | `web/app/(app)/documents/TagCatalogTab.js`, visibility in `web/lib/tagCatalog.js` |
| Recipes tab | `web/app/(app)/documents/RecipesTab.js`, rows and redaction in `web/lib/recipeCatalog.js` |
