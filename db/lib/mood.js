//
//   It SUMS. A drink is one drink however many statuses it lands, but "the
//   ingredient does most of the work" only means anything if a second slot
//   adds to the first. Two delicacies in a Lavish Meal are worth both.

//   It can be NEGATIVE. Relief is a max over a table of positives; a dish
//   made of feces is the worst thing in the game and has to be able to say so.
//
//   It returns the two halves SEPARATELY, never netted. Only harm is ever
//   scaled — by k, and by the multiplier stack — so netting +45 of saffron
//   against -55 of feces first would quietly charge the eater a scaled -10
//   instead of an unscaled +45 and a scaled -55. They are two things that
//   happened at one meal, not one thing.
//
// DISGUST carries noMultiplier, the way DRIFT does. Three of the rules in
// MULTIPLIERS apply to `kinds: "*"`, and while "Brave halves your disgust at
// eating a liver" is arguable, "the Rite of Rage makes feces free" and
