// A band across the top — the face, the blackletter name, five tiles, the turn
// and combat boxes, and every verb in one strip — over TWO columns: what you
// have on the left (the tag rail, the inventory, the bio), and what you are
// wearing, how you feel and what you want on the right. Under 720px they stack.
// The whole thing scrolls as one ordinary page; nothing here scrolls inside
// itself.
//
// It was three columns behind a You / Do / Tags tab bar until phase 4 of the
// game 3 redesign (docs/design/mockups/character/index.html is the spec). The
// middle column existed mostly to give the bio form somewhere to be, and the
// tabs hid two thirds of a sheet on a phone — so reading your own wound cost
// two taps.
//
// The props are built once in character/page.js#FreshCharacter, which is also
// what /chat's YOU column reads from, so the two surfaces cannot disagree
// about what a character is carrying.
//
// The file this replaced was the older sheet — PageShell, chips for tags, an
// icon rack of verbs. The .ledger-* class names and the LedgerBand/LedgerWork
// components are that rebuild's own, kept on purpose rather than churned;
// SHEET.md §6 says why.
